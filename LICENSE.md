# Licensing Overview (Docs Repository)

This documentation repository uses a practical, content‑type based licensing model to make reuse clear and developer‑friendly.

Content types and their licenses:

- Documentation (text, images, diagrams): CC BY 4.0
- Code samples and scripts: MIT
- Schemas and specifications (OpenAPI, JSON Schema): Apache‑2.0

Why this split?
- CC BY 4.0: documentation can be freely shared and adapted with attribution.
- MIT: code examples are copy‑paste friendly with minimal friction.
- Apache‑2.0: specifications benefit from explicit patent language and clear reuse terms.

Full license texts are provided under `LICENSES/`:
- `LICENSES/CC-BY-4.0.txt`
- `LICENSES/MIT.txt`
- `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`

Notes
- Unless a file explicitly states otherwise, apply the license above based on the file’s content type.
- Optional per‑file headers may be added over time for clarity:
  - Markdown: `<!-- License: CC BY 4.0 — see LICENSE.md -->`
  - Code: `// License: MIT — see LICENSE.md`
  - Schemas: `# License: Apache-2.0 — see LICENSE.md`

Trademarks
- See `TRADEMARKS.md` for guidance on using TWN Labs names, logos, and marks.
