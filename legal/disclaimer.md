# TWN Labs — Disclaimer

Last Updated: September 2025

## 1. Scope

This Disclaimer applies to TWN Labs products and services, including AI twins/agents, websites, apps, APIs/SDKs, marketplace listings, documentation, and communications (the "Services"). It should be read together with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If there is any conflict, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy control.

## 2. No Investment Advice

Information provided by TWN Labs is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment, financial, or trading advice, a solicitation, or an offer to sell or buy any securities, commodities, or digital assets. Decisions are your sole responsibility. TWN Labs is not a broker‑dealer, exchange, money transmitter, investment adviser, or fiduciary, and this document is not a prospectus or offering memorandum.

## 3. No Professional Advice; Life‑Critical Uses

Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. They are not a substitute for professional advice. Do not use the Services for life‑critical, medical, legal, financial, or safety‑of‑life decisions without appropriate human review and independent verification.

## 4. Tokens and Rewards

TWN is a utility token intended for product access and usage. Holding TWN does not grant profits, revenues, dividends, equity, voting, governance, or rights to company assets. Any creator recognition, rewards, airdrops, discounts, or rebates—if any—are discretionary, usage‑ or rules‑based program mechanics and do not constitute profit/revenue sharing, dividends, investment returns, or guarantees of value.

## 5. Public Twins, Visibility, and Caching

If you set a twin to public, you authorize TWN Labs to make the twin’s public profile/assets and behavior endpoints discoverable on TWN Labs platform surfaces (e.g., website/app profiles, search, marketplace) and callable via APIs/SDKs, subject to rate limits and policies. Public information may be indexed, cached, or mirrored by third parties; removal from third‑party caches/mirrors is not guaranteed. Public listings do not imply endorsement or identity verification by TWN Labs; unless explicitly stated, we do not independently verify claims of identity or affiliation.

## 6. On‑Chain Permanence

Certain twin metadata (e.g., name, image pointer, description, language, twin/NFT ID, creator wallet, timestamps) may be written on‑chain and is generally public and immutable. Do not include personal data on‑chain beyond what is strictly necessary and what you are comfortable making public. TWN Labs does not take custody of user funds or private keys and cannot reverse or recall blockchain transactions.

## 7. Model Outputs and Similarity

As between you and TWN Labs, and subject to applicable law and third‑party rights, you own the Outputs generated for you and we grant you any rights we may have in those Outputs for your lawful use under the Terms. Due to the probabilistic nature of AI, similar or identical outputs may be generated for different users; exclusivity of Outputs is not guaranteed.

## 8. User Content and Third‑Party Services

You are responsible for the accuracy, legality, and permissions/consents for content you provide (including voice, image, likeness, and personal data). TWN Labs is not responsible for third‑party services, links, or endpoints you enable (e.g., webhooks, integrations), which are governed by their own terms and policies.

## 9. No Warranties; Limitation of Liability (Summary)

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, TWN Labs disclaims liability for indirect or consequential losses. Full warranty disclaimers and liability limitations are set out in the Terms of Service (including mandatory legal carve‑outs where required by law).

## 10. Changes

We may update this Disclaimer from time to time. Material changes will be communicated as appropriate. Your continued use of the Services after updates take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Disclaimer.

## 11. Forward‑Looking Statements

Plans, roadmaps, targets, and timing are forward‑looking and subject to change. Actual results may differ materially due to technical, regulatory, or market factors. Non‑binding targets are provided for transparency and do not create obligations.

## 12. No Listing, Liquidity, or Price Guarantees

Nothing herein constitutes a commitment to list on any exchange, provide liquidity, or support any particular price level. Market availability and pricing are outside of TWN Labs’ control.

## 13. Regional Availability and Restrictions

Access to certain features, tokens, or Services may be restricted by law or policy in specific jurisdictions (e.g., geofencing, age checks). Availability may change without notice to comply with local requirements.

## 14. Taxes

You are solely responsible for determining and paying all taxes, fees, and duties arising from your activities. TWN Labs may collect or withhold taxes as required by law.

## 15. Service Availability and Security

We aim for secure and reliable operation but do not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free Services. Scheduled maintenance, third‑party outages, and network conditions may affect availability. Security measures reduce risk but cannot eliminate it.

## 16. Beta/Experimental Features

Some features may be labeled beta/experimental. Such features may be changed, rate‑limited, or withdrawn at any time and are provided without warranties.

## 17. Rate Limits and Fair Use

We may apply or adjust rate limits, quotas, and fair‑use policies to protect users and maintain service quality. Third‑party names, logos, and trademarks are the property of their respective owners and are used for identification only.

## 18. Third‑Party and Open‑Source Components

The Services may depend on third‑party or open‑source components, which are provided on their own terms. TWN Labs disclaims responsibility for third‑party failures or changes.

## 19. Export Controls and Sanctions

Use of the Services must comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws. You may not use the Services where prohibited by such laws.

## 20. Biometrics and Consent (Reference)

Voice and other biometric‑derived processing require explicit consent where applicable. Consent can be withdrawn; future processing will stop and off‑chain copies will be deleted where feasible, subject to legal/operational constraints. See the Privacy Policy for details.

## 21. Transparency and Reporting

Transparency reports, metrics, and disclosures are provided on a best‑effort basis and may be subject to timing, network, or reconciliation limitations. Check the latest updates on official channels. If this Disclaimer is translated, the English version controls to the extent of any conflict, except where local law requires otherwise.

## 22. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and Precedence

This Disclaimer is subject to the governing law and dispute resolution provisions in the Terms of Service (including any arbitration and small‑claims provisions and non‑waivable consumer rights). In case of conflict, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy prevail. If you have a separately executed agreement (e.g., MSA or DPA) that expressly governs a particular Service, that agreement controls for that Service to the extent of any direct conflict.

## 23. Chain Forks and Protocol Changes

In the event of blockchain forks, protocol upgrades, or third‑party platform changes, TWN Labs may determine, in its discretion, which networks or versions to support. We have no obligation to support any particular fork or token, and availability may change without notice.
