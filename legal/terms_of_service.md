# TWN Labs — Terms of Service

Last Updated: September 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using TWN Labs products and services, including AI twins/agents, websites, apps, and related features (the "Services"), you agree to these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 2. Eligibility and Accounts

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required by local law where higher, such as 16 in parts of the EU/UK). You are responsible for your account credentials and for all activities under your account. You are solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and completeness of information you provide. You must keep your credentials and any connected wallets secure; all actions initiated from your account or wallet are deemed authorized by you.

## 3. Wallets and On‑Chain Interactions

- Wallet custody and security are your responsibility. We do not control on‑chain transactions and cannot reverse them.
- On‑chain records are public and generally immutable. Do not put personal data on‑chain beyond what is necessary and appropriate.
- Certain twin metadata (e.g., profile name, image pointer, description, language, twin/NFT ID, creator wallet) may be permanently visible on‑chain.

Selecting “private” inside the app restricts off‑chain/app surfaces and API access. It does not hide or remove on‑chain records (e.g., name, image pointer, description, language, twin ID, creator wallet), which remain publicly visible.

## 4. Tokens and No Rights

TWN is a utility token intended for product access/usage. Holding TWN does not grant profits, revenues, dividends, equity, voting, governance, or rights to company assets. Any airdrops or in‑app rewards are discretionary, rules‑based mechanics and are not guarantees of value or investment returns. Any creator recognition or rewards are usage‑ or rules‑based program mechanics and do not constitute profit sharing, revenue sharing, dividends, or investment returns.

### 4.1 iNFT Ownership — No Profit/Revenue Rights
Owning or minting an iNFT does not entitle any holder to profits, revenues, dividends, revenue sharing, or distributions from TWN Labs or its affiliates. iNFTs represent identity/entitlements for twins on‑chain and may unlock utility features; they are not equity or a claim on company revenues.

## 5. Permitted Use; Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

You agree to use the Services lawfully and responsibly. You must not:
- Violate any law or third‑party rights (IP, privacy, publicity).
- Upload or generate content you lack rights to (e.g., voice/likeness without permission).
- Impersonate others or misrepresent a twin’s nature, source, or authorization.
- Attempt to bypass security, rate limits, or abuse anti‑automation protections.
- Interfere with the Services’ operation or use the Services to harm others.
- Provide false, inaccurate, or misleading information, or fail to keep information current where required.
- Fail to obtain and maintain all necessary rights, permissions, and consents for Customer Content, including voices, images, likenesses, and any personal data you provide.
We may suspend or terminate access for violations. We may, but are not obligated to, monitor content or activity; you remain solely responsible for your conduct and Customer Content. Without limiting the foregoing, you must not use the Services for life‑critical, medical, legal, financial, or safety‑of‑life decisions without appropriate human review and independent verification, and you must not use Outputs as a substitute for professional advice.

## 6. User Content and Customer Content

You retain ownership of content you submit or generate in the Services ("Customer Content"). You grant TWN Labs a limited, worldwide, non‑exclusive license to use, host, reproduce, and display Customer Content solely to provide and operate the Services and enforce these Terms and our policies. We do not use Customer Content to train foundation models unless you opt in (see Privacy Policy §4.1). "Customer Content" means the prompts, inputs, uploads, and outputs you submit or generate via the Services.

For clarity, you are solely responsible for content, claims, and activities expressed by or through your iNFT(s) and twins. TWN Labs does not endorse such content and assumes no liability for compliance, accuracy, or infringement. You must ensure compliance with applicable laws and third‑party rights.

### 6.1 Representations and Warranties (Customer Content)
You represent and warrant that:
- You own or have obtained all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to submit and use Customer Content with the Services, and to grant the foregoing license to TWN Labs.
- Customer Content is accurate, lawful, and does not infringe or violate any intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other rights of any person.
- You have provided all notices and obtained all consents required by law (including, where applicable, biometric, voice, image, or likeness consents) before submitting Customer Content.
- You are solely responsible for Customer Content, your prompts, and your use of outputs; we are not responsible for decisions or outcomes based on outputs.
- You are responsible for maintaining backups of Customer Content; we do not guarantee storage or retrieval.

## 7. Model Outputs and Responsibility

Outputs may be incorrect or inappropriate. You are responsible for evaluating outputs and for how you use them. Do not rely on outputs as professional advice.

As between you and TWN Labs, and subject to applicable law and third‑party rights, you own the Outputs generated for you, and we grant you any rights we may have in those Outputs for your lawful use under these Terms. Due to the probabilistic nature of AI, similar or identical outputs may be generated for different users; we do not guarantee exclusivity of any Output.

## 7A. Public Twins, API and Platform Visibility
If you set a twin to public, you authorize TWN Labs to make the twin’s profile and any public assets or behavior endpoints discoverable and callable by other users or applications via APIs/SDKs, and viewable on TWN Labs platform surfaces (e.g., website/app profiles, search, marketplace), subject to rate limits, quotas, and policy. Public information may be indexed, cached, or mirrored by third parties.

Publicly visible items (depending on your settings and applicable policies) may include:
- Basic profile information (e.g., name/handle, description, tags, languages)
- Appearance assets or references (e.g., image thumbnails or pointers)
- Voice previews/samples, if you explicitly enable previews and where permitted
- Declared capabilities or behavior endpoints, and high‑level usage indicators where applicable
- Creator handle or public identifier (e.g., wallet or profile reference)

You are responsible for ensuring you have all rights and consents to make such content public and for complying with law and these Terms. We may remove or restrict public exposure for safety, legal, or policy reasons. Removal from third‑party caches or mirrors is not guaranteed and may require requests to such third parties.

## 8. Third‑Party Services and Integrations

You may enable webhooks or third‑party integrations. Data shared to endpoints you control or third parties is governed by their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third‑party services.

## 9. Privacy

Your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and protect information (including biometrics consent, on‑chain vs off‑chain handling, cookies, and user rights).

## 10. Intellectual Property

The Services, including software, models, and content provided by TWN Labs, are protected by IP laws. Except as expressly permitted, you may not copy, modify, create derivative works, or reverse engineer any part of the Services.

## 11. Feedback

If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a non‑exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty‑free, worldwide license to use it without restriction.

## 12. Fees, Billing & Taxes

You agree to pay applicable fees for the Services and any marketplace transactions. We may change fees or pricing with reasonable advance notice where required. You are responsible for all applicable taxes; we may collect or withhold taxes as required by law. We may throttle, suspend, or terminate access for non‑payment or abuse of billing systems.

Unless required by law, fees and charges are non‑refundable, including for partial periods, unused services, or downgrades. Cancellations stop future billing cycles but do not entitle you to refunds for past periods. Any credits are at our sole discretion. Chargebacks or payment disputes may result in suspension or termination. Nothing in this Section limits any non‑waivable consumer refund or cooling‑off rights under applicable law. We may resolve billing disputes in good faith and, where legally required, offer pro‑rata or statutory refunds.

## 13. Changes to the Services and Terms

We may modify the Services or these Terms. Material changes will be notified as appropriate. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance. We may adjust features, rate limits, quotas, and access policies at any time to maintain security and service quality.

## 14. Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these Terms, our policies, or law, or to address security risks. Upon termination, your rights under these Terms end, but sections that by their nature should survive will survive.

## 15. Disclaimers (No Warranties)

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non‑infringement. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free.

## 16. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will TWN Labs or its affiliates be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenues, goodwill, data, or use, arising from or related to the Services. To the fullest extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability for all claims shall not exceed USD 0. If a zero cap is unenforceable, the cap is the greater of USD 100 or amounts you paid (if any) in the prior 12 months for the Service giving rise to the claim.

The foregoing limitations do not apply where prohibited by law, including for liability arising from willful misconduct or fraud, death or personal injury caused by negligence to the extent required by law, or any non‑waivable statutory rights.

## 17. Indemnification

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TWN Labs and its affiliates from any claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your Customer Content, your use of the Services, your violations of law or these Terms, or your integrations/webhooks/third‑party services you enable.

## 18. Notice‑and‑Action; Repeat Infringer Policy

If you believe your rights are infringed (e.g., unauthorized voice/likeness), notify legal@twnlabs.com with details (contact info, description, location/IDs, basis). We may remove or restrict content and suspend accounts as appropriate. We may terminate accounts that repeatedly infringe others' rights. For copyright notices under applicable law, you may also contact our designated agent at legal@twnlabs.com.

## 19. Export and Sanctions Compliance

You must comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws. You may not use the Services if you are located in, or are a resident or national of, a country or region subject to comprehensive sanctions or if you are on a restricted party list.

## 20. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

Except where prohibited by applicable law or provided otherwise for consumers in specific jurisdictions, these Terms are governed by applicable law without regard to conflict of laws principles.

### 20.1 Arbitration; Class Action Waiver
To the fullest extent permitted by law, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under applicable arbitration rules. Proceedings will be in English. You and TWN Labs waive any right to a jury trial and agree that claims may be brought only in your or our individual capacity, not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to legal@twnlabs.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. This arbitration agreement does not prevent either party from seeking relief in small claims court where available. If you are a consumer and applicable law provides non‑waivable forum or process rights, those rights are not affected by this Section.

### 20.2 Court Venue (If Arbitration Unenforceable)
If the arbitration agreement is found unenforceable as to a particular claim or remedy, or where arbitration is not permitted by law, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of courts of competent jurisdiction for such matters not subject to arbitration. Consumers in the EU/UK may have the right to bring claims in their country of residence under mandatory law.

## 21. Force Majeure

We are not liable for failure or delay due to events beyond our reasonable control, including natural disasters, wars, terrorism, labor disputes, internet or utility failures, and governmental actions.

## 22. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and TWN Labs regarding the Services and supersede prior agreements. If any provision is found unenforceable, it will be severed, and the remainder will remain in effect. You may not assign these Terms without our consent; we may assign them in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale. No waiver will be effective unless in writing. If you have a separately executed agreement with TWN Labs (e.g., MSA or DPA) that expressly governs a particular Service, that agreement will control to the extent of any direct conflict with these Terms for that Service.
